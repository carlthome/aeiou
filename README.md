We recommend you install the latest version from GitHub via

However binaries will be occasionally updated on PyPI, installed via

``` sh
pip install aeiou
```

## How to use

This is a series of utility routines developed in support of multiple
projects within the [Harmonai](https://www.harmonai.org/) organization.
See individual documentation pages for more specific instructions on how
these can be used. Note that this is *research code*, so it’s a) in flux
and b) in need of improvements to documenation.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome – especially for improvements to
documentation! To contribute:

1.  Fork this repo and then clone your fork. This library is written
    entirely in [nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/) version 2, using Jupyter
    notebooks.

2.  [Install nbdev](https://nbdev.fast.ai/getting_started.html#install)
    and then you can edit the Jupyter notebooks. To prepare your code
    for `git commit`, run `nbdev_prepare` first.

3.  If that succeeds, you can do `git add *.ipyb aeiou/*.py; git commit`
    and then `git push` to get your changes to back to your fork on
    GitHub.

4.  Then send a Pull Request from your fork to the main `aeiou`
    repository.
